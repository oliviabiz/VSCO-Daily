# VSCO-Daily

Some VSCO utilities for personal use

* vsco-scraper.py: script to download all images off of a VSCO account, using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
* randomizer.py: selects a random image in a directory and adds a disposable camera style timestamp of date taken
* uploader.py: gets a random image and uploads it to Imgur, sends it using photosender.py, then deletes image off of Imgur
* photosender.py: uses Twilio to send an image via MMS

the result... I can text myself a random image from my VSCO account! like "memories" for VSCO! wow!
